### 4.2.22 Push Notifications

Validation will be tested by sending notifications while the application is not running to verify that the push notifications are recieved either through email or the mobile device's notification bar. It will also be verified that if the user does not have email or mobile notification permissions turned on, the push notification will remain active inside of the application and will be visible to the user the next time the application is opened. The application will be tested to verify that the user may successfully create and add a new notification to their Calendar. It will be verified that invalid input from the user will not be accepted. Please see 3.2.22.1 for details on invalid input.
