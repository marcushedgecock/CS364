### 4.2.4 Priority View

Validation will be successful if the application is able to display a priority list when the user taps on a specific day.

#### 4.2.4.1 Assignment Priority List

A test will be performed to ensure that clicking on every week-day displays a list view of assignments and tasks for the day. If a day does not contain any assignments or tasks, then a message should be shown to the user stating that there are no assignments or tasks for the day. In addition, the list view must show the items ranked by due-date and level of priority. For example, if there are several assignments due on a specific day, and all have different deadlines, then the assignment with the earliest deadline with be on top of the list and will have a level of priority label (High, Medium, or Low) that was previously assigned by the user. 

#### 4.2.4.2 Task Priority Labels

Task labels (High, Medium, Low) will be added to new custom tasks. A test will be performed to verify that the tasks are properly ranked showing the appropriate priority label. If no priority label has been assigned, then the user must see a text saying "add priority" next to the item.
