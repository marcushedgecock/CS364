### 4.2.24 Simplified To-Do Assignment Display

Validation will be successful if the user is able to go to the simplified to-do assignment page of the app, and view their assignments one at a time. It will be verified that the exception paths for this feature will execute as defined in the 3.2.24 exception path details.

#### 4.2.24.1 Completing an assignment

The simplified to-do assignment display will be tested to verify that when the button that marks an assignment as complete is pressed, that item will no longer show up on the to-do list. It will be verified that if the user presses an arrow button and the check mark button at the same time, the path will not be executed and the assignment will not be marked as complete.

#### 4.2.24.2 Navigating through assignments

The application will be verified by using the navigations buttons to cycle through the to-do list, and make sure all items on the list are shown. The feature will be tested to verify that when both arrow buttons are pressed together, the action will be nullified. 

#### 4.2.24.3 Adding assignments to the list

Adding items to the list will be tested by selecting the "add to my to-do list" button, and verifying the assignment is added to the to-do list. It will be verified that if the user does not enter any text for the assignment to be added, an error message is displayed prompting them to try again.
